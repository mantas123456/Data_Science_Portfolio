# ðŸ§  Predictive Modeling of Sports Outcomes

## Overview
This project builds machine learning models to predict the outcome of sports matches based on historical data.

## Goals
- Collect or simulate realistic sports datasets
- Perform EDA and feature engineering
- Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluate model performance (Accuracy, F1, ROC AUC)
- Explore model interpretability (SHAP, feature importance)

## Structure
- `data/`: raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and modeling
- `models/`: saved models and pipelines

## Results
Highlights of best model performance and insights.

## Future Work
- Add ensemble techniques
- Incorporate more contextual features (e.g., player form, injuries)
